## Archived extension: SigChecker

The git history of this repository contains an unmaintained MediaWiki extension
which performed validation of talk page edits to ensure that they were signed
correctly with "~~~~". Only users in a blacklist, defined by
[[MediaWiki:unsigblacklist]], were required to pass this validation.
